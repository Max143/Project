As instructed in the assignement. To use the clever cloud platform to host the data. 
I have hosted the PostgreSQL database at clever cloud platform.

Data was in huge amount. While adding data from to database, causes Not responding to my system and crashes.
And processes was slow. Taking much time to add data to the database server. 
So, I deciced not to host complete data. It has approx. 55k rows added. Actuall rows was in lacs. 

My system problem of getting slow and not responding, won't let me or take much time.
